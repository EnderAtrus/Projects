Sent: Sat Jul 05 21:23:56 CDT 2014:  No worries! We'll just have to go again another weekend. I can completely respect staying to help your family. If you had to pick a reason to stay that's a good one. And we might play ghosts in the graveyard after, if you're up for it.
Sent: Sat Jul 05 21:50:10 CDT 2014:  Will do! Let us know when you're free for the night.
Sent: Sat Jul 05 22:11:34 CDT 2014:  Oh, It's okay I just tell people he's my retarded brother. By the way the movie is a double feature if you still feel like swinging by one you're done.
Sent: Sat Jul 05 22:43:32 CDT 2014:  I don't know for sure, but we're only forty minutes into the first movie. So  we'll probably be here for a while yet.
Sent: Sat Jul 05 23:42:34 CDT 2014:  No worries. I'm sure we'll be able to hang out another weekend. We just finished the first movie.
